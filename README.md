My notes on whatever I happen to learn and document. I hope others find this info useful too.

If you find something I got wrong, could be better, think I and others should know then please open an issue and document it. I'll make sure you get credit in my footnotes and references. All I ask is that you make a constructive contribution. With all due respect, one thing I won't do is respond to issues or comments that are simply asking for justification of why I did something in the first place. We've all seen it before. It's just one person trying to put someone else on the defensive. Let's just keep everything constructive so we all learn more than we knew before. We're all learners trying to just learn more than we knew the day before.

I hope you find this stuff helpful. My first contibution to this project is about getting ldaps working on Windows. Surprisingly painful to do, especially for a Linux guy like me that's never worked with Windows AD CS and certificate templates before.

Cheers,
Sparky Z
